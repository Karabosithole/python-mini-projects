"""Python Set is an unordered collection of data that is mutable and does not allow any duplicate element. 
Sets are basically used to include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. The data structure 
used in this is Hashing, a popular technique to perform insertion, deletion, and traversal in O(1) on average. 

If Multiple values are present at the same index position, then the value is appended to that index position, 
to form a Linked List. In, CPython Sets are implemented using a dictionary with dummy variables, where key beings 
the members set with greater optimizations to the time complexity."""
